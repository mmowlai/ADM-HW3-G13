 The repository consists of:
* `collector.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to collect our data from the `html` page and Wikipedia.
* `collector_utils.py`: a python file that stores the function we used in `collector.py`.
* `parser.py`: a python file that contains the line of code needed to parse the entire collection of `html` pages and save those in `tsv` files.
* `parser_utils.py`: a python file that gathers the function we used in `parser.py`.
* `index.py`: a python file that once executed generate the indexes of the Search engines.
* `index_utils.py`: a python file that contains the functions we used for creating indexes.
* `utils.py`: a python file that gather functions we needed in more than one of the previous files like (`collector`, `parser`, etc.)
* `main.py`: a python file that once executed build up the search engine.
* `exercise_4.py`: python file that contains the implementation of the algorithm that solves problem 4.

* `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook explaines the strategies we adopted solving the homework.
